## Solution Written Description

The solution we propose is the Medi-Transformer, an AI-powered web app for improving and tracking the retention of medical knowledge. Our proposed Medi-Transformer takes in as input any digital learning resource, such as PDFs of textbook or lecture notes, powerpoints of lecture slides and Audio or Video Recordings of lectures. It then condenses, re-organizes and re-synthesizes the medical information into various bite-sized forms suited for easy retention. 

Medi-Transformer has 3 advantages: it supports multi-format, multi-media and multi-source learning. Firstly, the Medi-Transformer is multi-format. Given any medical learning resource, whether it is in text pdf, slides pptx, or audio or video recording, the Medi-Transformer is able to decompose the information within and reorganize it into a variety of different formats, such as Diagrams, Tables, Flashcards, and Practice Questions

Secondly, the Medi-Transformer supports multi-media conversion, and enables interconversion between different media types such as Text, Image, Audio or Video. For example, it allows a text pdf to be converted into an audio podcast, thus allowing users to listen on-the-go without hassle.  

Thirdly, the Medi-Transformer has the unique advantage of being Multi-source supportive. It will be able to Make connections between and also within different learning materials. Additionally, it will have an inbuilt Chatbot to enable students to ask questions on any of the learning materials uploaded. 

As an AI-powered app for improving and tracking the retention of medical knowledge, Medi-Transformer can motivate students to learn medical knowledge in an engaging way, increase students’ productivity, tailor the format of the content to fit students’ learning styles and monitor students’ progress.

## Solution Code Description

This repository contains dart files of UI mockups of our solution developed in FlutterFlow under the folder codes. We intend to refine the code in future to be integrated into a working Flutter desktop application. The screenshots of the mockups can be found under the folder flutterflow_mockups. The backend_functionalities folder contains functions for 3 of the main functionalities of our proposed Medi-Transformer web app (one function each to demonstrate multi-format, multi-media and multi-source learning).
